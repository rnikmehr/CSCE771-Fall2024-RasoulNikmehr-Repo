Research Interest

Graph Neural Network with Reinforcement Learning for Propagation Minimization
• Developed a graph neural network model in a supervised learning setup to minimize rumor propagation in a
network. This model can predict which nodes are useful to block so that infected nodes with rumor cannot
propagate information to other nodes.

• Planning to implement the graph neural network model in a reinforcemnet learning setup to do further
exploration.

Continual Learning on Graph Neural Network
• Currently exploring different benchmarking methods on graph continual learning.

Experience

Therap (BD) Ltd. July, 2020 – Present

Software Engineer, Machine Learning Dhaka, Bangladesh
• Developed and deployed a machine learning model that can predict the probability of a severe injury or
seizure of a patient in a specific period based on preceding data: used Cox Proportional-Hazard (CPH) and
Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model to develop this.

• Applied different statistical analyses and feature engineering to find similarities between multiple trends.

Pipilika, Bangla Search Engine September, 2019 – March, 2020

Intern at Research and Development Sylhet, Bangladesh
• Developed and integrated an automated crawler using Scrapy to crawl top news from prominent daily
newspapers.

• Fine-tuned a machine learning model that used the latest crawled news to extract keywords and summarise
them to display on the website.
