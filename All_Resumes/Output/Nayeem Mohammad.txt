PROJECTS

Sign-Language-App
• Developed a WebApp using Computer Vision to detect hand signs that takes real-time video inputs
• Used Deep Learning Models (VGG16 and MobileNet) to recognize the letters associated with the signs
• Optimized MobileNet using loss functions, optimizers, and activation functions
• Designed the WebApp using Flask; Integrated the Deep Learning model and Google API (text-to-speech)
• Used Technology: Python, OpenCV, Deep Learning, Google API, Colab, Flask, HTML, CSS Github GitHub

Simple Neural Network
• Developed a C++ implementation of a simple Neural Network that takes functions, input values (x), weights, and

biases as inputs
• Uses the Shunting-yard algorithm to parse the input function, dynamic programming solution for the differential

equation and calculates the prediction value (y)
• Identical version of the C++ implementation in GOLang
• Used Technology: C++, GO Github GitHub;

BlogApp
• Built a blog using Django and HTML/CSS
• Connected SQLite Database with the blog
• Built CRUD operations and federated login system
• Used Technology: Python, HTML, CSS Github GitHub

Siamese Network
• Implemented Siamese network to perform a person re-identification using One-Shot Learning
• Added a layer of Normalized Cross-correlation to improve the performance
• Optimized and Significantly improved results in terms of time complexity
• Used Technology: Deep Learning, OpenCV, Image Processing, TensorFlow, Python Github GitHub

Web Scraper
• Designed a web crawler that can scrape texts from websites using HTML parsing on source code
• Can extract images and HTML div(s) from websites
• A Flask app is wrapped around the crawler with a scraping option that takes links as inputs
• Used Technology: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup4, Flask, Python Github GitHub
