Experiences ____________________________________________________________________________
Graduate Research Assistant, Sutton Lab,University of South Carolina August, 2022-Present

● Implemented parameter based domain adaptation technique across the benchmark material Graph Neural Networks:
SchNet, PAiNN, ALiGNN in the pursuit of screening new double perovskite compounds. The traditional DFT level
screening takes around 1-2 months while our domain adaptation based approach leads the chemists to the new
compounds within minutes with a pretty low MAE of 0.038 eV/atom.

● Integrated equivariant graph neural network as an encoder for self-supervised learning (SSL). Currently, 250k unlabeled
double perovskite structures are used for the SSL task. This is the very first time an equivariant model has been added
on top of the downstream prediction task for inheriting best model parameters, and weights. The SSL module provides
better representation for the subsequent MLP as well.

● Predicted different material properties(Formation energy, Bandgap, Orbital Energy Spectrum) with GNN.
Graduate Teaching Assistant, Department of Computer Science, NewMexico Tech Jan, 2022-May, 2022

● Evaluated the assignments and projects of the Systems Programming course. This course includes system-level
programming based on OS services and other APIs.

Research Assistant, 4MLab, University of Louisiana at Lafayette June, 2020-Dec, 2021
● Processed DICOM images to generate the expected 3D mesh.
● Graph Neural Network has been applied over the CT scan images to predict the 3D shape of bone.
