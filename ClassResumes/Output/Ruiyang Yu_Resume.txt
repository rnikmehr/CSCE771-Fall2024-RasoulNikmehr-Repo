EXPERIENCE 

7.2021 – 9.2021 

INTERN, DOW CHEMICAL ZHANGJIAGANG CO LTD 

◆ Design and create critical equipment monitoring system. 
 This is part of the EC2M (Engineers Closer to Machines) project. The monitoring systems 

currently in use are designed for operators with complex and detail-oriented pages. The 
new monitoring system can display the safety state of the whole factory with simple 
and easy to read interface. Its users are mainly the management personnel. 

 The system summarizes nearly 200 critical equipment of Dow ZJG Plant. 
 Create templates for each device that contain parameters that the device may need to 

monitor. 
 Collect the sensors’ real time values from the OSIsoft PI system.  
 Work with field engineers to develop logic to determine device status based on 

parameter return values. 
 The overall status of each device is displayed in different color blocks and aggregated 

upward.  
 The user interface is divided into five levels: Factory overall status -> Plant status -> 

Area status -> equipment status -> equipment details", Provide managers with visual 
and real time safety status of all critical equipment. 

◆ Design and create internal information portal. Site features include: KPI statistics and 
analysis, plant safety information, news and announcements, public file management, 
automatic email reminders to employees who have not completed tasks, and online file 
approval.
