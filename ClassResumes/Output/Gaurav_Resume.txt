Experience

Sutton Lab
Graduate Research Assistant Jan 2024 - Present

• Working on leveraging generative models to propose molecular structures without exhaustive enumeration,
addressing the combinatorial scaling challenge in the design of new molecules and materials.

• Build a model to accurately predict JV Reverse Scan PCE of Perovskite Materials using GAM based models.

Yojak
Technical Lead May 2022 - Nov 2023

• Built a cross-platform native e-commerce application facilitating SKU scanning using QR code, products viewing,
and seamless order processing. Key features included real-time stock updates, secure online payment integration,
and robust order tracking capabilities.

• Developed an internal ERP tool to streamline and manage day-to-day business activities such as order creation,
accounting, procurement, logistics, and supply chain management. Integrated the tool with CRM for seamless lead
conversion.

• Set up automated deployment pipelines using AWS, CloudFront, S3, and Docker for backend and frontend.
Optimized build time of backend and frontend applications using Docker layer and GitHub caching.

Fractal Analytics
Data Scientist Sep 2020 - May 2022

• Built a Customer Lifetime Value model for a retail client to optimize marketing spend on different channels and
calculate ROI. Used an LSTM time series model to predict customers’ future spending for the next 12 months.

• Developed a product recommendation model using implicit collaborative filtering and created a multiplier to
prioritize seasonal items. Improved dollar sales by 7% ($100k/month) in an A/B test setup.

• Developed and deployed a lead-scoring model in real-time on Kubernetes using FastAPI to create the endpoint.
